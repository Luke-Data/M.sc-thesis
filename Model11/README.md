# Model 1.1

all method/model are base on Model 1.1

E(Y|X=x,Z=z) = x1 * f(z) + ... + xd * f(z)

where all coefficient function are function of same smoothing variable Z

# Model 1.1

NW --> VCM with costant local fit

LLR --> VCM with local linear function fit

LLP --> VCM with local cubic fit

# Mse

Bandwidth selector for LLR 

# Two step - estimate

allows you to choose different bands for different functions in two-step estimation

# KLASSO 

Group lasso penalty for nonparametric regression NW. Result and DPG see code and 'Plot' section
