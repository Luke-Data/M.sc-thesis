# AIM: two-step estimate of local linear model with optimized bandwidth

*Workflow:*

  1) Choose optimal bandwidth through MSE minimization criterion

  2) Estimate initial coefficient function with local linear 
  
  3) Select one singular coefficient function to estimate again with diffrent bandwidth
  
  4) Compute new coefficient through two-step estimate function
  
  (two-step optimal bandwidth is obtained through MSE criterion)
