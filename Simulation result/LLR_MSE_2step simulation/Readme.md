# AIM: two-step estimate of local linear model with optimized bandwidth

*Workflow*

1) Estimate with local linear

2) Choose optimal bandwidth

3) Select one singular coefficient function to improove

4) Compute another function estimate with new bandwidth trought two_step estimate

(New bandwidth calculate with MSE bandwidth optimization)
